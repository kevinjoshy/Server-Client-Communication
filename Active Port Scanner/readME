Port scanner.
A port scanner is a program that tries to find out which ports on a host machine have actively listening
servers. A simple way to do this is to iterate over the ports, trying to establish a connection on each one.
Once a connection is established, the scanner can further determine whether the server listening on the
port is a web server by sending to the server a message starting with the string “GET” and checking if the
response begins with “HTTP”. 

This Port Scanner defaults to localhost and scans between ports 20 and 100
You can specify what host or range you wish.
